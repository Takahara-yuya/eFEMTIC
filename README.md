# eFEMTIC (Extended Finite Element MagnetoTelluric Inversion Code) 
eFEMTIC is a 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) and controlled-source electromagnetic inversion code developed based on FEMTIC (v4.3).  
For more information about the FEMTIC code, please refer to the original FEMTIC repository: https://github.com/yoshiya-usui/femtic  

--->>> 
This release introduces a new ​CSEM module​ integrated into the FEMTIC framework, enabling electromagnetic modeling and simulation workflows.  
The module is designed to work seamlessly with the existing FEM-based infrastructure and is aimed at geophysical, engineering, or scientific computing applications.  

# Release note  
v4.3.0-e1.0 (Jan. 1, 2026): Supports forward modeling and inversion of Controlled-Source Electromagnetic (CSEM) problems with arbitrary-shaped electric and magnetic sources under Tetrahedral mesh.
